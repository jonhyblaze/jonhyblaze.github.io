        <p>Hi folks, as you already know my name is Anna, but you probably don't know much else about me.<br /> So today i'm gonna adress just that. I was born in a small town, where I lived for a good part of my life, it was chill place with descent community, but I newer really fit it, it was too small for me at the time, I always wanted to live in a big city. <br><br>
        
My family was always supportive at the time, and they gave me chance to obtain good education, which I gladly did. Sadly, it wasn't enough for me to kick-off, the lack of parctical expirience wasn't giving me any chance to land a proper job.
<br><br>
But after some hastle I've made my way into the tech, so these days I spend my days mostly on the web prototypes.
What are you guys think about my story, maybe somebody can share his in a coment section below. <br><br>Cheers guys, have a good one! </p>

            This year I've discovered a world of yoga! It's very challenging but more so rewarding. I encourage you guys to try it out, I'm pretty sure you gonna stick to it.
One tip from me though, try to use an app to get into the rhythm, it a has been a great help, at list for me.
